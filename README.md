Project 3: Make Something COOL!
Plant Capacitance/Music Dual Visualizer
I wanted to do something less literal for this project. This is
a plant capacitance and music visualizer. You must have an arduino loaded with
the appropriate code on it for this to work (see arduino file). Connect your arduino to a plant 
with a paper clip and the lines will respond when you touch the plant (with frequency
sound as well). Talk or play music into the microphone, and the sphere will visually respond.
This is intended for projection in a dark room, at an installation or
music show.
References for code are cited in my project paper.

HOW TO USE:

Step 1
- Create plant-friendly sensor for capacitance sensing. Use aluminum foil, a paper clip or an electrode to connect a plant to an alligator clip
  
Step 2
- use the following circuit diagram to wire your arduino uno:

Step 3

- Upload arduino uno capacitance sensor code to arduino
  
Step 4

- unplug arduino and replug arduino, load Processing sketch
